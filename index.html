                    <h2>What is Prime Time all about?</h2><p>Prime Time Preschool will provide your child with a positive first school experience - the first step. Our program is geared toward helping children develop the ability to observe, question, and listen.&#160; It gives them an awareness of their own feelings and their right to express those feelings in an appropriate manner. Prime Time encourages positive self-esteem through independent decision making. They learn that they are free to make choices, as long as they stay within the limits of consideration for people and things.&nbsp; An individualized program like ours prepares children to utilize their intellectual and creative abilities in future learning tasks. </p><p>A unique aspect of Prime Time is the ratio of staff to students.&nbsp; Three caring teachers will staff each class of 20 students.&nbsp; Our program allows for an ongoing consistent relationship with the children.&nbsp; Prime Time also emphasizes communication between parents and staff. This is accomplished through parent-teacher conferences, monthly newsletters, and detailed activity calendars.</p><h2>Prime Time History</h2><p>Prime Time Preschool was established in 1992 and opened in the Fall of 1994. The co-founders of the preschool were Lynda Schoonover, Deb Kirchen, and Beth Cook who worked together at a preschool in Lansing called Sunshine House. At that time, play-based preschools were not readily available in the DeWitt area. It was felt that with using the model of Sunshine House as a guide, a quality preschool experience could be provided for DeWitt-area families.</p><p>At the same time, Redeemer United Methodist Church was beginning a building expansion project. The preschool was fortunate to be included in the planning for the classrooms in this building expansion which now houses the preschool.</p><p>It has been a cooperative effort of families, friends, and staff to ensure the long standing continued success of the preschool.</p>
