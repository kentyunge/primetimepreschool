            I am so proud to say that our children attended Prime Time
            Preschool. I appreciate the small class size, teacher to child
            ratio, and the skills they teach them through play. I feel like our
            children joined Prime Time as toddlers and came out as tiny little
            humans that could do things for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            My children still light up every time we drive by Prime Time and
            remember the teachers and their time there very fondly. I also love
            how much we run into our Prime Time teachers in the community and at
            sporting events. The teachers really take pride in our community and
            make the kids feel special even when they leave the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could not recommend Prime Time Preschool enough and hope you get
            the chance to have your children experience it too,
          </p>

            From the first time we visited, observed and toured Prime Time I was
            so impressed with the teachers and the students. The class was
            organized and under control, while still fun and exciting. It was
            evident that the teachers had a love for their profession and the
            children. The teachers made us feel welcome and answered any
            questions we had, which made the transition from being home all day
            with mom to going to preschool two afternoons a week very smooth.
          </p>

            Our son, Colin adored his teachers from the very beginning of the
            school year, he even played pretend preschool at home, taking on the
            role of "Mrs. Cook", with my husband, daughter and I playing the
            part of the "friends". It was a great way for us to have a window
            into his preschool life. As a classroom volunteer, and through
            Colin's pretend play, I can attest that the teachers are patient,
            kind and nurturing towards the children. It was fun to see how
            excited Colin was to go to preschool, where he played, learned and
            grew; he even asked about going on his days off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the highlights during the school year, were the first day of
            school, with parents attending with their child, so we could all
            become more comfortable. The Halloween party, in which all the kids
            were dressed up. The Christmas program, with entire families in
            attendance to watch the kids perform adorable songs. The Valentine's
            Day party attended by Dads and Mother's Day party. As a parent who
            loves to document the milestones in her child's life, it was so nice
            to be invited and welcomed into the classroom to experience a
            special day that will be a beloved memory. I also really appreciated
            the parent-teacher conferences each semester. The teachers
            accurately and professionally presented information about where our
            son was at and the progress he had made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, Prime Time was the ideal first step for our son into his
            school career. We look forward to many more wonderful years with all
            of our children taking their first step with Prime Time.

            When my older daughter was getting close to preschool age, I decided
            to research the options in my community. Hands down, everyone I
            talked to had wonderful things to say about Prime Time Prechool.
            Even before the first day of school, I could tell that we had chosen
            a great school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything about the school is very well thought out and planned to
            support the children and their families. From the parent orientation
            to the monthly calendars and newsletters, the organization, care,
            and effort put into their program is evident and communicated
            clearly throughout. All of this really made us feel confident about
            choosing Prime Time for our children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now both of our daughters are Prime Time graduates. Even though they
            have very different personalities and learning needs, they were both
            given the attention and support they needed. Even more so, they both
            gained an early love of school and learning to give them the best
            start possible. Even as she goes into 3rd grade, my older daughter
            still talks about how much she loved preschool and all of the
            teachers she had.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good school will teach your children, keep them safe, and support
            their learning at home as well. A great school does all of those
            things and makes you and your children feel like family. Prime Time
            goes above and beyond to be a great school. Even though we are done
            with preschool now, we will always feel like we are part of the
            Prime Time Family.
