<p><strong>Teacher Bios</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christy Vostrizansky</strong><br /> I began my teaching career at Corunna Public Schools teaching 1st and 2nd grade. In 2011, I started teaching at Prime Time Preschool.&nbsp; I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and a Minor in Journalism from Oakland University.&nbsp; I also have a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education from Michigan State University and a Masters degree in Teaching from Marygrove College.&nbsp; In 2015 I became Assistant Director at Prime Time and work alongside the director, Lynda Schoonover.&nbsp; My daughters all attended Prime Time Preschool and we loved this amazing program, its philosophy and the dedication to providing children with a positive first school experience</p>
<!--<p><strong>Carrie Yunge</strong><br /> This is my second year teaching at Prime Time Preschool. My daughter Zoe went for two years and is now a first grader. My youngest, Nora, attended last year, and I am very excited to get to have Nora in my class for her last year in preschool! I am an elementary certified teacher with a degree from Michigan State University and my Masters in curriculum and teaching from MSU too! Go Green! I have taught in East Lansing, Michigan Center, Australia, Malaysia, and online too! I am looking forward to a wonderful year at Prime Time!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>-->
<p><strong>Lynda Schoonover</strong><br /> I have been Director and head teacher at Prime Time Preschool for 20 years. After receiving a B.A. and an Elementary Teaching Certificate from Adrian College, I began my career in teaching third and fourth grade in the Pickney Community School System. I completed work on my masters in Education at EMU. When my youngest of three sons entered first grade I taught preschool at Sunshine House Preschool in Lansing. We opened Prime Time in 1994 and I have been teaching there even since.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Stumpfig</strong><br /> I started teaching at Prime Time in 1999. I graduated from Hope College with a B.S. in Biology. I become acquainted and subsequently, fell in love with Prime Time's program when my daughters attended.</p>
<p><strong>Marin Whitten</strong><br /> I graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Preschool and Family Life Services. The year we moved to DeWitt my husband and I enrolled our middle son in Prime Time. Soon thereafter, I fell in love with the warm and caring environment. Our younger two children went on to attend and I later served on the Prime Time Board as a Member at Large. After spending time raising our four children, I returned to teaching. I love working with preschoolers and firmly believe in the philosophy at Prime Time. I am pleased to be a part of such a quality program.</p>
<p><strong>Charissa Karr</strong><br/> I am so excited to be joining the fantastic staff at Prime Time this year! My son attended the 4 year old Prime Time class last year, and we fell in love with the program as parents. This year, my daughter will attend the 3 year old class. When  an opening came available to teach on staff, I jumped at the opportunity to join such a dedicated team. :) 
    I hold a bachelor’s degree in elementary and early childhood education from Clark Summit University and a master’s degree in special education and curriculum from Liberty University. I added the Early Childhood ZA endorsement to my certificate as well, early in my career. I have been a teacher in and out of the classroom for 10 years! I love making teaching fun and memorable! I currently teach English to Chinese students through VIP Kids in the early morning hours each day! I am excited to add teaching at Prime Time to my Tuesday and Thursday routines. 
    Outside the classroom, I enjoy spending time with my family – enjoying nature and baking delicious cookies with my kids. I love to travel anywhere warm and sunny and spend time reading and playing the piano! It is my goal to make learning engaging and entertaining so every child can be confident and competent in their learning skills.

<p><strong>Meg Reed</strong><br/>Since 2008, when my daughter started at Prime Time Preschool, becoming a teacher here has been my dream job. I graduated from Alma College in 2001 with a degree in elementary education.  In 2005, I started a home daycare, to allow me to stay home with my children, and which I ran until 2012. For five years, I homeschooled our three children. They went back to public school in 2017. With two children in high school, and one in middle school, it was time for a change for me. Being able to realize my dream after twelve years is amazing! I look forward to being a part of this amazing program. </p>
