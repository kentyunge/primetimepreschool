            I have been Director and head teacher at Prime Time Preschool for 20
            years. After receiving a B.A. and an Elementary Teaching Certificate
            from Adrian College, I began my career in teaching third and fourth
            grade in the Pickney Community School System. I completed work on my
            masters in Education at EMU. When my youngest of three sons entered
            first grade I taught preschool at Sunshine House Preschool in
            Lansing. We opened Prime Time in 1994 and I have been teaching there
            even since.

            I graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Bachelor of
            Science Degree in Preschool and Family Life Services. The year we
            moved to DeWitt my husband and I enrolled our middle son in Prime
            Time. Soon thereafter, I fell in love with the warm and caring
            environment. Our younger two children went on to attend and I later
            served on the Prime Time Board as a Member at Large. After spending
            time raising our four children, I returned to teaching. I love
            working with preschoolers and firmly believe in the philosophy at
            Prime Time. I am pleased to be a part of such a quality program.

            <strong>Meg Reed</strong><br />Since 2008, when my daughter started
            at Prime Time Preschool, becoming a teacher here has been my dream
            job. I graduated from Alma College in 2001 with a degree in
            elementary education. In 2005, I started a home daycare, to allow me
            to stay home with my children, and which I ran until 2012. For five
            years, I homeschooled our three children. They went back to public
            school in 2017. With two children in high school, and one in middle
            school, it was time for a change for me. Being able to realize my
            dream after twelve years is amazing! I look forward to being a part
            of this amazing program.

            <strong>Desha Bambenek</strong><br />My family moved to DeWitt in
            2017. We have four children that I stayed home to raise & we were
            lucky to gain a spot at Prime Time where we quickly became
            passionate about the school & staff. I graduated from Central
            Michigan University where I ran the 400m hurdles for the track team
            (my legs arenâ€™t as quick as they use to be!). We lived in Farmington
            Hills, then spent a decade near Lake Michigan in St. Joseph, before
            settling closer to family. We love the DeWitt community & now that
            my youngest is in Kindergarten, I am blessed & excited to be
            involved with the children & families of the Prime Time community. I
            love fun & laughter & that is what I hope to share with my new
            little friends!

            I began my teaching career after graduating from Central Michigan
            University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Education. I taught
            kindergarten through third grade for over ten years before leaving
            my position in St. Johns to become a stay-at-home parent. I am ready
            to get back into the classroom now that my daughter is in
            kindergarten. I firmly believe in the philosophy at Prime Time and
            I'm grateful to be joining this amazing team. I am looking forward
            to working with preschoolers and getting to know all of the
            families.
