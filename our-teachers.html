<p><strong>Teacher Bios</strong></p>
<p><strong>Christy Vostrizansky</strong><br /> I began my teaching career at Corunna Public Schools teaching 1st and 2nd grade. In 2011, I started teaching at Prime Time Preschool.&nbsp; I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications and a Minor in Journalism from Oakland University.&nbsp; I also have a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education from Michigan State University and a Masters degree in Teaching from Marygrove College.&nbsp; In 2015 I became Assistant Director at Prime Time and work alongside the director, Lynda Schoonover.&nbsp; My daughters all attended Prime Time Preschool and we loved this amazing program, its philosophy and the dedication to providing children with a positive first school experience</p>
<p><strong>Beth Cook</strong><br /> After receiving a B. A. and teaching certificate from Alma College in 1967, I began my career in education teaching kindergarten. Once I had raised my three children, I returned to teaching in a preschool called Sunshine House in Lansing, MI from 1991 through 1993. Prime Time Preschool opened in 1994 and I taught there for two years before my husband and I left the area in 1996. We returned in 2000 and I resumed teaching at Prime Time from that time to the present.</p>
<p><strong>Maria Cook</strong><br /> This is my 23rd year at Prime Time Preschool and I am the Monday-Wednesday-Friday p.m. head teacher. I also currently work (part time) for Clinton County RESA, our intermediate school district, in the early childhood area where I am the Great Start Parent Liaison. I graduated from Central Michigan University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree and a teaching certificate in elementary education. My continuing education was done at Michigan State University. My teaching career began at St. Mary's School in Westphalia where I taught 5th grade. From there, I moved on to Waverly Community Schools for 8 years where I taught both 2nd grade and Kindergarten. In the past, I have taught parenting classes for Clinton County Counseling Center and worked for Sparrow Clinton Hospital as the Safe Kids Coordinator. I have two grown daughters who both attended Prime Time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Carrie Yunge</strong><br /> This is my second year teaching at Prime Time Preschool. My daughter Zoe went for two years and is now a first grader. My youngest, Nora, attended last year, and I am very excited to get to have Nora in my class for her last year in preschool! I am an elementary certified teacher with a degree from Michigan State University and my Masters in curriculum and teaching from MSU too! Go Green! I have taught in East Lansing, Michigan Center, Australia, Malaysia, and online too! I am looking forward to a wonderful year at Prime Time!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Lynda Schoonover</strong><br /> I have been Director and head teacher at Prime Time Preschool for 20 years. After receiving a B.A. and an Elementary Teaching Certificate from Adrian College, I began my career in teaching third and fourth grade in the Pickney Community School System. I completed work on my masters in Education at EMU. When my youngest of three sons entered first grade I taught preschool at Sunshine House Preschool in Lansing. We opened Prime Time in 1994 and I have been teaching there even since.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Stumpfig</strong><br /> I started teaching at Prime Time in 1999. I graduated from Hope College with a B.S. in Biology. I become acquainted and subsequently, fell in love with Prime Time's program when my daughters attended.</p>
<p><strong>Marin Whitten</strong><br /> I graduated from Northern Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Preschool and Family Life Services. The year we moved to DeWitt my husband and I enrolled our middle son in Prime Time. Soon thereafter, I fell in love with the warm and caring environment. Our younger two children went on to attend and I later served on the Prime Time Board as a Member at Large. After spending time raising our four children, I returned to teaching. I love working with preschoolers and firmly believe in the philosophy at Prime Time. I am pleased to be a part of such a quality program.</p>
